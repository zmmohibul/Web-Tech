                        <p>The graceful, winding arms of the majestic spiral galaxy M51 (NGC 5194) appear
                            like a grand spiral staircase sweeping through space. They are actually long lanes of stars
                            and
                            gas laced with dust.

                            This sharpest-ever image, taken in January 2005 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard
                            the
                            NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, illustrates a spiral galaxy's grand design, from its
                            curving
                            spiral arms, where young stars reside, to its yellowish central core, a home of older stars.
                            The
                            galaxy is nicknamed the Whirlpool because of its swirling structure.</p>

                        <p>The Whirlpool galaxy, M51, has been one of the most photogenic galaxies in
                            amateur and professional astronomy. Easily photographed and viewed by smaller telescopes,
                            this
                            celestial beauty is studied extensively in a range of wavelengths by large ground- and
                            space-based observatories. This Hubble composite image shows visible starlight as well as
                            light
                            from the emission of glowing hydrogen, which is associated with the most luminous young
                            stars in
                            the spiral arms.</p>

                        <p>These images by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope show off two dramatically different
                            face-on views of the spiral galaxy M51, dubbed the Whirlpool Galaxy.

                            The image at left, taken in visible light, highlights the attributes of a typical spiral
                            galaxy, including graceful, curving arms, pink star-forming regions, and brilliant blue
                            strands of star clusters.</p>
