                <p>The Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as Messier 51a, M51a, and NGC 5194, is an interacting grand-design
                    spiral galaxy with a Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus. It lies in the constellation Canes
                    Venatici, and was the first galaxy to be classified as a spiral galaxy. Its distance is estimated
                    to be 23 million light-years away from Earth.

                    The galaxy and its companion, NGC 5195 are easily observed by amateur astronomers, and the two
                    galaxies may be seen with binoculars. The Whirlpool Galaxy has been extensively observed by
                    professional astronomers, who study it to understand galaxy structure (particularly structure
                    associated with the spiral arms) and galaxy interactions..</p>

                <p>What later became known as the Whirlpool Galaxy was discovered on October 13, 1773, by Charles
                    Messier while hunting for objects that could confuse comet hunters, and was designated in Messier's
                    catalogue as M51.[12] Its companion galaxy, NGC 5195, was discovered in 1781 by Pierre Méchain,
                    although it was not known whether it was interacting or merely another galaxy passing at a distance.
                    In 1845, William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, employing a 72-inch (1.8 m) reflecting telescope at
                    Birr Castle, Ireland, found that the Whirlpool possessed a spiral structure, the first "nebula" to
                    be known to have one.[13] These "spiral nebulae" were not recognized as galaxies until Edwin Hubble
                    was able to observe Cepheid variables in some of these spiral nebulae, which provided evidence that
                    they were so far away that they must be entirely separate galaxies even though they are seen close
                    together.[14]

                    The advent of radio astronomy and subsequent radio images of M51 unequivocally demonstrated that the
                    Whirlpool and its companion galaxy are indeed interacting. Sometimes the designation M51 is used to
                    refer to the pair of galaxies, in which case the individual galaxies may be referred to as M51a (NGC
                    5194) and M51b (NGC 5195).</p>

                <h2>Visual Appearence</h2>
                <p>Located within the constellation Canes Venatici, M51 is found by following the easternmost star of
                    the Big Dipper, Eta Ursae Majoris, and going 3.5° southwest. Its declination is +47°, making it a
                    circumpolar for observers located above 43°N latitude; it reaches high altitudes throughout the
                    northern hemisphere making it an accessible object from the early hours in winter through the end of
                    spring season, after which observation is hindered in lower latitudes.[citation needed]

                    M51 is visible through binoculars under dark sky conditions, and it can be resolved in detail with
                    modern amateur telescopes.[11] When seen through a 100 mm telescope the basic outlines of M51
                    (limited to 5×6') and its companion are visible. Under dark skies, and with a moderate eyepiece
                    through a 150 mm telescope, M51's intrinsic spiral structure can be detected. With larger (>300 mm)
                    instruments under dark sky conditions, the various spiral bands are apparent with HII regions
                    visible, and M51 can be seen to be attached to M51B.

                    As is usual for galaxies, the true extent of its structure can only be gathered from inspecting
                    photographs; long exposures reveal a large nebula extending beyond the visible circular appearance.
                    In 1984, thanks to the high-speed detector—the so-called image-photon-counting-
                    IPCS—system—developed jointly by the CNRS Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiald (L.A.S.- CNRS) and the
                    Observatoire de Haute Provence (O.H.P.) along with the particularly nice seeing offered by the
                    Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (C.F.H.T.) 3.60m Cassegrain focus at Mauna Kea summit in Hawaii, Hua
                    et al. detected the double component of the very nucleus of the Whirlpool galaxy (article in
                    Astrophysical Letters and Communications, 1987, vol. 25, pp. 187–204).

                    In January 2005 the Hubble Heritage Project constructed a 11477 × 7965-pixel composite image (shown
                    in the infobox above) of M51 using Hubble's ACS instrument. The image highlights the galaxy's spiral
                    arms, and shows detail into some of the structures inside the arms.[15]</p>
